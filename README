Linux Lighting Architecture - LLA
===============================================================================

LLA consists of three parts, the daemon llad, the llad plugins and the client
library, liblla.


Plugins
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are located in ./plugins. To create a new plugin you'll need to subclass the
Plugin, Device and Port classes. See any of the current plugins for an example.


C++ Library
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is located in ./lla . You'll want to create a new LlaClient and call start().
To do anything useful you'll need to subclass LlaClientObserver and implement
some of the methods.

If you have pthreads installed this library *should* be thread safe (currently
implemented with one big lock).


Libraries in Other Languages (Python)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are experimental Python libraries you can build by running configure with
--enable-python-libs. For examples see the tests directory.

The python library seems to be working well. Perl isn't supported as the
current version of SWIG doesn't support Perl directors.
