--URGENT--
resend DMX on idle (artnet every 4s)
handle POSTs
fix thread locks in the web interface
add the console


--REQUIRED--

* fix recv dmx with the python libs
* allow for finer grained channel control (set_block, set_channel)
* tx pathport support
* regression tests for plugins

-- NICE--
* let the ports save what universe they are attached to (do this in the plugin)
* serialise so that plugins can store state

--UNIMPORTANT--
* send debug to remote client - need to watch looping here (maybe lev 1&2)

--WISH LIST--

* consider using filters:
	o split dmx to different universes OUT = SPLIT(1,0,255)
	o invert channels OUT = INV(1)
	o different merge modes OUT = HTP(1,2)
	o change offset / map  OUT = OFFSET(1, +50)
	o scaler (OUT = SCALE(1, %40) )
	o clip (OUT = CLIP(1,%80) )
