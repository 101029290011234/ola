--URGENT--

* fix up the lla_req_* functions (wtf does this mean?)
* convert char *name in device.h (twice)

--REQUIRED--
* shownet recv  - DONE
* enttec open - DONE
* sandnet - DONE
* pro support working ??

-- NICE--
* serialise so that plugins can store state
* perhaps lla_con could start llad if not already running ?
* remember plugin id : plugin mappings
* send debug to remote client - need to watch looping here (maybe lev 1&2)
* let the devices save what universe they are attached to
* save universe names (universe manager??)
* get dev msgs working


--WISH LIST--

* support HTP merge mode (currently LTP) - do we need to be able to 
set the mode on a per channel or per universe basis ? Think about if we
might need "filters" to modify the data from plugins. Could get really funky:
	o split dmx to different universes OUT = SPLIT(1,0,255)
	o invert channels OUT = INV(1)
	o different merge modes (OUT = HTP(1,2))
	o change offset / map  OUT = OFFSET(1, +50)
	o scaler (OUT = SCALE(1, %40) )
	o clip (OUT = CLIP(1,%80) )
