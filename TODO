--URGENT--
* fix timeout issues in client programs


--REQUIRED--

* fix potential for NULL pointers in client (eg. devices freed on call to req_dev_info)
* support fragmented messages in the client and notify when all fragments arrive
* pathport support
* pro support working ??

-- NICE--
* get dev msgs working
* save universe names (universe manager??)
* let the devices save what universe they are attached to (do this in the plugin)
* serialise so that plugins can store state
* split dependancy between universe and port attributes
* send debug to remote client - need to watch looping here (maybe lev 1&2)


--WISH LIST--

* support HTP merge mode (currently LTP) - do we need to be able to 
set the mode on a per channel or per universe basis ? Think about if we
might need "filters" to modify the data from plugins. Could get really funky:
	o split dmx to different universes OUT = SPLIT(1,0,255)
	o invert channels OUT = INV(1)
	o different merge modes OUT = HTP(1,2)
	o change offset / map  OUT = OFFSET(1, +50)
	o scaler (OUT = SCALE(1, %40) )
	o clip (OUT = CLIP(1,%80) )
