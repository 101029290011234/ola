--URGENT--

* default ip address issue
* universe not created when a single client sends (make sense really)
* sandnet bug
* move autogen into Makefiles ( check for libtemplate-perl)

--REQUIRED--

* tx pathport support
* regression tests for plugins

-- NICE--
* let the ports save what universe they are attached to (do this in the plugin)
* serialise so that plugins can store state
* convert to using autogen'ed messages:
    * need to be able to nest msg structures
* fix potential for NULL pointers in client (eg. devices freed on call to req_dev_info)
* support fragmented messages in the client and notify when all fragments arrive

--UNIMPORTANT--
* send debug to remote client - need to watch looping here (maybe lev 1&2)

--WISH LIST--

* consider using filters:
	o split dmx to different universes OUT = SPLIT(1,0,255)
	o invert channels OUT = INV(1)
	o different merge modes OUT = HTP(1,2)
	o change offset / map  OUT = OFFSET(1, +50)
	o scaler (OUT = SCALE(1, %40) )
	o clip (OUT = CLIP(1,%80) )
