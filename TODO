--URGENT--

* complete audit for return values
* implement universe subscribe - monitor + sample program
* fix up the lla_req_* functions
* remove hard coded ip address from plugins
* shownet recv 

--REQUIRED--
* serialise so that plugins can store state
* perhaps start llad if not already running ?
* remember pid : plugin mappings

-- NICE--
* send debug to remote client - need to watch looping here (maybe lev 1&2)


--WISH LIST--

* support HTP merge mode (currently LTP) - do we need to be able to 
set the mode on a per channel or per universe basis ? Think about if we
might need "filters" to modify the data from plugins. Could get really funky:
	o split dmx to different universes OUT = SPLIT(1,0,255)
	o invert channels OUT = INV(1)
	o different merge modes (OUT = HTP(1,2))
	o change offset / map  OUT = OFFSET(1, +50)
	o scaler (OUT = SCALE(1, %40) )
	o clip (OUT = CLIP(1,%80) )
